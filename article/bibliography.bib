  abstract   = {Summary Distributed energy management of interconnected microgrids
                  that is based on model predictive control (MPC) relies on the
                  cooperation of all agents (microgrids). This paper discusses
                  the case in which some of the agents might perform one type of
                  adversarial actions (attacks) and they do not comply with the
                  decisions computed by performing a distributed MPC algorithm.
                  In this regard, these agents could obtain a better performance
                  at the cost of degrading the performance of the network as a
                  whole. A resilient distributed method that can deal with such
                  issues is proposed in this paper. The method consists of two
                  parts. The first part is to ensure that the decisions obtained
                  from the algorithm are robustly feasible against most of the
                  attacks with high confidence. In this part, we formulate the
                  economic dispatch problem, taking into account the attacks as
                  a chance-constrained problem, and employ a two-step
                  randomization-based approach to obtain a feasible solution
                  with a predefined level of confidence. The second part
                  consists in the identification and mitigation of the
                  adversarial agents, which utilizes hypothesis testing with
                  Bayesian inference and requires each agent to solve a
                  mixed-integer problem to decide the connections with its
                  neighbors. In addition, an analysis of the decisions computed
                  using the stochastic approach and the outcome of the
                  identification and mitigation method is provided. The
                  performance of the proposed approach is also shown through
                  numerical simulations.},

Due to scalability limits and privacy issues of individual subsystems, attack identification methods should not rely on global model knowledge. We address systems of interconnected nonlinear subsystems with coupled dynamics or constraints in a distributed control setup. The local controllers share information about the coupling variables of the subsystems and are designed to be robust towards attacks and uncertain influences through neighboring subsystems. We present a scalable hierarchical attack identification method which monitors the evolution of the coupling variables after an attack occurred in some unknown subsystem. Based on the mutual exchange of local sensitivity information among the subsystems, the propagation of the attack through the network is approximated. The propagation equations are used to formulate a quadratic program whose solution determines the attack signal that explains the observed network evolution best. The developed approach is applied to the IEEE 30 bus system to illustrate attack identification in power systems with faulty buses.},

In this precise area of building thermal modelling issues of model accuracy and computational efficiency become important. In this work a nonlinear constrained optimization method is used for reducing the model order of building elements. The approach involves minimizing the error between the step response of a high-order reference model whilst tuning the parameters of a lower order model in order to obtain an optimized reduced-order model. Results show that a reduced model based on a 2nd-order building element gives minimal loss of accuracy but significant improvements in computational effort when treating both high and low thermal capacity modelling problems.},
